# CS145-COVID Prediction Project
A machine learning project for UCLA's CS145 Data Mining course. We aim to predict the number of COVID19 cases and fatalities for a given state, month, and day using data sourced 
from JSU CSSE's dataset. This data can be found here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
